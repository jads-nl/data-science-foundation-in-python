# Data visualization with Python

This chapter provides an introduction to data visualization with Python, specifically for the purpose of Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and presenting the results from a data science project in an interactive document (dashboard, app).

## Exploratory Data Analysis

> The term Exploratory Data Analysios (EDA) is mostly attributed to Tukey (1977). In EDA, oneâ€™s aim is not to draw conclusions on predefined research questions (be it the construction of a model, the estimation of parameters, or the confirmation or rejection of a hypothesis); in fact, EDA in problem solving is often applied to data collected without well-defined hypotheses. In EDA, one screens the data for clues that could inspire ideas and hypotheses.

_ de Mast & Kemper (2009)

Read the [paper by de Mast & Kemper (2009)](demast2009principles.pdf) to understand what the purpose of EDA and how it fits in the context of a data science project.

## Interactive data visualization

Interactive data visualization makes it possible to present results in interactive online documents. Read and follow along with the exercises in the introduction notebook to get started.

## Altair as the library of choice

Altair is chosen as the main library to demonstrate how an _interactive_ Grammar of Graphics helps you in reasoning about the process of creating interactive data visualization.
