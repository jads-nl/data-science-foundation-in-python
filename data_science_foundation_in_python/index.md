# Why this JupyterBook?

Whilst teaching data science courses at [EAISI Academy](https://www.tue.nl/en/research/institutes/eindhoven-artificial-intelligence-systems-institute/ai-education/professional-education/eaisi-academy), I often get requests to show _how_ to apply the theory. Given that there is a lot of great content avaialable in the creative commons, I have curated, combined and remixed these into an integrated online curriculum for ease of use.

This foundational data science curriculum is based on the following textbooks and online courses:

- [Introduction to Statistical Learning with Applications in R, 2nd Edition (ISLRv2)](https://statlearning.com) by James, Witten, Hastie, Tibshirani (2021).
- [Hands-on Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras and Tensorflow, 2nd Edition (handson-ml2)](https://github.com/ageron/handson-ml2) by Aurélien Géron (2019).
- [Altair Visualization Curriculum](https://uwdata.github.io/visualization-curriculum/intro.html), developed at the University of Washington by Jeffrey Heer, Dominik Moritz, Jake VanderPlas, and Brock Craft.
- [Interpretable Machine Learning, 2nd Edition (IMLv2)](https://christophm.github.io/interpretable-ml-book/) by Christoph Molnar (2022).
- [Forecasting: Principles and Practice, 3rd Edition (fpp3)](https://otexts.com/fpp3/) by Rob J Hyndman and George Athanasopoulos (2021).
- [Advanced NLP with spaCy](https://course.spacy.io/en/).

Since three of these use R (ISLRv2, fpp3 and IMLv2), and we have chosen Python as our primary language for instruction, the main contribution of this JupyterBook is to provide a wide set of Python-based notebooks with exercises and examples. Besides my own work, I have integrated various respositories, blog posts etc. which I found useful and fitting within this curriculum. Attributions and links are provided in each section separately.

## Getting started with Python for Data Science

Those new to Python and seeking to get started quickly, I recommend using the following books:

- [A Whirlwind Tour of Python](https://github.com/jads-nl/WhirlwindTourOfPython), by [Jake VanderPlas](http://vanderplas.com/) (2016).
- [Python Data Science Handbook](https://github.com/jads-nl/PythonDataScienceHandbook), also by [Jake VanderPlas](http://vanderplas.com/) (2018). 
- [Python for Data Analysis, 3rd Edition](https://wesmckinney.com/book/), by [Wes McKinney](https://wesmckinney.com/) (2022).
